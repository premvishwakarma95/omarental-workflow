# omarental-workflow

I can help with home repair issues in a rental property, such as:
- Plumbing: leaking taps, blocked sinks/toilets, low water pressure
- Electrical: sockets not working, lights out, tripping fuse box
- Heating: boiler not working, radiators cold, no hot water
- Appliances: washing machine, dishwasher, oven, cooker issues
- General household: doors/hinges, cupboards, loose fittings, minor damage
- Safety issues: water leaks, electrical sparks, gas smells (emergency)

Just tell me what’s going wrong in your flat/house 👍
